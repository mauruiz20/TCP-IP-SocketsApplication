# TCP-IP-SocketsApplication

<p> At the present time the most popular computer communication protocol suite worldwide is without any doubt TCP/IP. All familiar network applications, such as telnet, ftp, web servers, email, etc. are developed above it. This publication introduces the foundation for building such applications using one of the available programming interfaces known as socket interface. This publication starts introducing the TCP/IP protocol suite briefly in order to define the term socket. Then, the two main sockets types are defined, as well as their use in distributed applications. The most important system calls used in network programming are shown. The publication finishes with a network program, which demonstrates the use of the system calls introduced and the programming structure in distributed application in TCP/IP networks. </p>

## Statement
An application must be created that performs a scan of the web servers that are in a subnet.

<b>The application should do the following tasks:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Show a welcome message.</li>
  <li>Request the input (via the keyboard) of the IP address of the subnet.</li>
  <li>For each IP addressable range of hosts, check if it corresponds to a Server Web or not.</li>
  <li>Show the result on the screen.</li>
  <li>Show goodbye message and finish the application.</li>
</ul>
